# Object Communication

## Delegate

* Great pattern, but limited to a one-to-one relationship.

## NSNotificationCenter

Not `NSUserNotifications`

* it broadcasts information for other objects
* kind of like a radio station, with a single point that broacasts information, and many objects that can recieve that data, if they want.

## KVO

Key Value Observing.

## Blocks

```objc
^{

};
```

# Controls `target-action`

# Touches

# Gestures
